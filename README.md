# Gitea for StartOS

[Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) is a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go.
It is published under the MIT license. This repository creates the `s9pk` package that is installed to run `gitea` on [StartOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/).

## Dependencies

## Cloning

Clone the Gitea package repository locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:Start9Labs/gitea-startos.git
cd gitea-startos
```

## Building

To build the **Gitea** service as a universal package, run the following command:

```
make
```

Alternatively the package can be built for individual architectures by specifying the architecture as follows:

```
make x86
```

or

```
make arm
```

## Installing (on StartOS)

Before installation, define `host: https://server-name.local` in your `~/.embassy/config.yaml` config file then run the following commands to determine successful install:

> :information_source: Change server-name.local to your Start9 server address

```
start-cli auth login
#Enter your StartOS password
make install
```

**Tip:** You can also install the gitea.s9pk by sideloading it under the **StartOS > System > Sideload a Service** section.

## Verify Install

Go to your StartOS Services page, select **Gitea**, configure and start the service.

**Done!**
